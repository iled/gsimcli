Installation

Currently there is no stand-alone installer.

Python version support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only Python 2.7 was tested. It should be easy to upgrade to Python 3.2+.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`__: 1.8 or higher
  * `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`__: 0.13.0 or higher
  * `DSS <https://sites.google.com/site/cmrpsoftware/geoms>`__: only the binary
  * `Wine <https://www.winehq.org>`__: only for \*nix systems
  
.. note::

   pandas has a list of dependencies, some mandatory, other recommended and
   some other just optional. Although, you are highly encouraged to install
   them as they may be necessary in GSIMCLI.
   
   On the other hand, if you installed Python through a packaged distribution,
   changes are that you already have those libraries.
